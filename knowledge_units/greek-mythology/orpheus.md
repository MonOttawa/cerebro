### Output
> Orpheus is more known for his musical ability than his heroics; nonetheless, Orpheus was part of the Argonauts in Jason&#039;s quest for the Golden Fleece. When his wife, Eurydice, was bitten by a snake and died, Orpheus braved the Underworld and Hades to bring her back. He was given permission to do with the caveat that he not look at her until having reached the light of day, but he disobeyed; sadly, Eurydice was lost forever. Would you like to talk about other Greek heroes?
