### Output
> Aphrodite is the goddess of love and beauty, often said to have been born from the foam of the sea near Cyprus (thus, many believe her name to mean &#039;foam-risen&#039;). Aphrodite is usually shown as having two sides: the softer, weaker side, and that which is evil and manipulative. In most Greek mythology, Aphrodite is the wife of Hephaestus, the god of the forge, although she maintains an affair with Ares, the god of war. Aphrodite&#039;s sacred tree is the myrtle and her sacred birds the dove, sparrow, and swan.
