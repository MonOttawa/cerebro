### Output
> Prometheus and the Theft of Fire is about how fire came to humanity. According to the myth, Prometheus stole fire from the gods&#039; palace on Olympus, hid it in a hollow reed, and gave it to humans. Enraged, Zeus chained Prometheus to the Caucasus mountains. Every day, Zeus sent an eagle to eat Prometheus&#039;s liver; this torture went on until many years later, when Zeus&#039;s demigod son, Hercules, would free him.
