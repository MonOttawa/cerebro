> Okay! Jason was the son of the dethroned king of Iolcos. He quested to find the Golden Fleece, gathering a crew of companions called the Argonauts, about whom you can learn more [here](https://www.thoughtco.com/who-were-the-argonauts-119307). Over the course of his adventures, Jason came face-to-face with many mythical monsters and other difficulties, such as hypnotic sirens and harpies. He married a woman named Medea and later abandoned her; she subsequently murdered their children and Jason died despairing and lonely. Would you like to learn about another hero?
