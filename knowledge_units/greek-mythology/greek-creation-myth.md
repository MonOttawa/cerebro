### Output
> Cool! Creation myths are humanity&#039;s attempt at explaining the reason our universe exists. In Ancient Greece, many believed that the universe created the gods. At first, there was only Chaos (nothingness), which eventually spawned Gaia, (the Earth), Eros (Love), the Abyss (Tartarus), and the Erebus (often known as Darkness). Love created Light and Day, and Gaia created Ouranos (Heaven). Gaia and Ouranos had many children: the Hecatonchires (hundred-handed ones), the Cyclops, and lastly the Titans: Oceanus, Tethys, Hyperion, Theia, Coeus, Phoebe, Kronos, Rhea, Mnemosyne, Themis, Crius and Iapetus. The Titans were eventually succeeded by the children of Kronos and Rhea, the Olympians (Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, Poseidon, and Zeus). The number of Olympians eventually grew to twelve, composed of Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Demeter, Athena, Apollo, Artemis, Ares, Hephaestus, Aphrodite, Hermes, and either Hestia or Dionysus.
