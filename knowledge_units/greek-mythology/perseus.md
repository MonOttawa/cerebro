### Output
> All right! Perseus was a son of Zeus and the slayer of Medusa. As Medusa&#039;s gaze turned the viewer into stone, Perseus looked at her reflection in a shield and was thus able to kill her. While returning from his quest, Perseus also rescued the princess Andromeda from the sea monster Cetus and married her. Upon reaching home, Perseus found that his mother had been hurt by King Polydectes, and used Medusa&#039;s head to turn him to stone. He then sacrificed the head to Athena, who had aided him during his quest. Would you like to learn about another hero?
