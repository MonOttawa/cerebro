### Output
> Atalanta is one of my favorite Greek heroes (or heroines, in this case!). She was an amazing fighter and very fast, known for being the first hunter to wound the Calydonian Boar (sent by an angry Artemis; learn more [here](https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Monsters/Calydonian_Boar/calydonian_boar.html)), as well as one of the only female [Argonaut](https://press.rebus.community/mythologyunbound/chapter/the-argonauts/). She also married the first man who could beat her in a race: Hippomenes, who used [three golden apples](https://greatgreekmyths.weebly.com/the-golden-apples.html) as a distraction in order to achieve victory and marriage to his love. Would you like to talk about another hero?
