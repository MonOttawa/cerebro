> Ares is the god of war and the son of Zeus and Hera. Despite being a god of war, Ares is often depicted as cowardly, whiny, and murderous. On the battlefield, Ares is accompanied by various minor gods: Eris (Discord), Strife, and Enyo (Bellona), as well as Terror, Trembling, and Panic. Ares appears in Greek mythology as the lover of Aphrodite. Ares&#039;s sacred bird is the vulture as well as the dog.
