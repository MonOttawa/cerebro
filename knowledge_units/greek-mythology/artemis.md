### Output
> Artemis, also known as Diana or Cynthia, is the goddess of the hunt and the moon as well as the protectress of youth and maidens and purity.  She is the child of Zeus and Leto and the twin of Apollo. Although she is the goddess of the moon, other goddesses fill that role as well, namely Selene, the sister of Helios, the sun-god. In some poems, Artemis is associated with Hecate, the goddess of the Dark of the Moon, in addition to Selene. Artemis&#039;s symbols are bow and arrows, her sacred animal the deer, and her sacred tree the cypress.
