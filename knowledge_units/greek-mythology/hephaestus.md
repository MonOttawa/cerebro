### Output
> Hephaestus is the god of fire. Whether he is the son of Zeus and Hera or Hera alone is often disputed. He is commonly described as ugly and lame, cast out by his parents at birth in some stories. Despite this, Hephaestus is depicted as a kind and peaceful god. He serves as the armorer and blacksmith for the Olympians. In the Iliad, Hephaestus is married to one of the three Graces, Aglaia, whereas in the Odyssey he is married to Aphrodite. Hephaestus, along with Athena, is the patron of handicrafts, specifically the protector of smiths.
