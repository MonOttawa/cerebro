### Output
> Zeus is the king of the gods, as well as the sky and thunder god. The word &#039;Zeus&#039; is thought to have come from the Ancient Greek word for &#039;bright.&#039; He is often depicted with a thunderbolt or the Aegis, an enormous shield decorated with the head of a Gorgon; other symbols of this god are the eagle and the oak tree. Although Zeus is married to Hera, he has many extramarital affairs over the course of Greek mythology. Some of his notable illegitimate children are Athena, Apollo and Artemis, Hermes, Dionysus, Heracles, Helen of Troy, and the Muses, while some of his equally important legitimate children with Hera are Hephaestus, Hebe, and Ares.
