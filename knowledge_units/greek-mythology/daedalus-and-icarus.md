### Output
> Awesome! King Minos, the king of Crete, commissioned Daedalus and Icarus to build a giant labyrinth below his palace to contain the Minotaur, a half-man half-bull monster. When Daedalus and Icarus had finished construction, Minos imprisoned them within the labyrinth. In an effort to escape, Daedalus collected feathers from birds and glued them together with wax until he had constructed four wings. Daedalus warned Icarus not to fly too close to the sun for fear the wax would melt, but when they had escaped, Icarus paid no heed to his father&#039;s warning. He flew too close to the sun, the wax melted, and Icarus drowned in the sea below. Would you like to hear other myths?
