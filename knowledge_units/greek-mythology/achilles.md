### Output
> Great! Achilles was the child of sea nymph Thetis, who, in an attempt to make him immortal, dipped him in the River Styx while holding him by the heel. Achilles was the most important Greek soldier during the Trojan War, killing the Trojan prince Hector. Later, however, Achilles would be slain by Paris, who shot an arrow guided by the gods to pierce Achilles&#039;s vulnerable heel- the part that is today known as the Achilles tendon. Would you like to learn about another hero?
