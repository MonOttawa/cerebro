### Output
> There were 12 original Titans: Oceanus, Tethys, Hyperion, Theia, Coeus, Phoebe, Cronus, Rhea, Mnemosyne, Themis, Crius and Iapetus. Cronus, or Kronos, was the leader of the Titans after having overthrown his father Ouranos (Uranus), and taken his place. A prophecy foretold that Cronus would also be usurped by his son. In order to prevent this, Cronus swallowed his children as they were born. One, Zeus, managed to escape. He gained his father&#039;s throne after winning the Titanomachy, the great war between the Titans and the Olympians.
