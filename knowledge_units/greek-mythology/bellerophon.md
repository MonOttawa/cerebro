### Output
> Good choice! Bellerophon is most known for taming winged horse Pegasus, as well as slaying the chimera. Unfortunately, however, Bellerophon grew egotistical and convinced himself that he was not a man but a god, and attempted to ride Pegasus all the way to Mount Olympus. Angered, Zeus killed Bellerophon mid flight. Are you interested in talking about another Greek hero?
