> This myth is very interesting! It&#039;s one of my favorites. When the son of Minos, (the king of Crete), was killed in Athens, Minos required that year, seven young men and seven young women be sent to Crete to wander through a labyrinth and eventually be eaten by the Minotaur, a half-man half-bull monster. Theseus, the son of the king of Athens, chose to go one year, arriving in Crete and falling in love with Minos&#039;s daughter, Ariadne, who then gave him a skein of string so that he would not be lost in his journey into the labyrinth. With the aid of the string, Theseus was able to not get lost and kills the Minotaur, fleeing Crete. On the way back to Athens, however, the couple lands on the island Naxos, where Theseus leaves Ariadne and continues back to Athens without her. Ariadne later becomes Dionysus&#039;s wife. I hope you liked the myth! If you want to learn more, check out this [link!](https://www.commonlit.org/texts/theseus-and-the-minotaur) Would you like to learn about another famous Ancient Greek myth?
