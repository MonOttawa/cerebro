> Great choice! The king of Ithaca, Odysseus is one of the most famous heroes, his adventures during the Trojan War having been chronicled in Homer&#039;s Iliad and his ten-year journey home in the Odyssey. Over the course of these adventures, Odysseus encounters a cyclops, is nearly seduced by sirens, and faces Scylla and Charybdis. His adventures culminate in his return home, where he finds that his wife, Penelope, has been requested to remarry so that a new king may rule Ithaca. Penelope sets a task for the suitors: if any one of them can string a bow and shoot an arrow through twelve axe heads, she would marry them. Odysseus, disguised as a beggar, easily completes this challenge, and reunites happily with Penelope and his son Telemachus. Would you like to learn about another hero?
