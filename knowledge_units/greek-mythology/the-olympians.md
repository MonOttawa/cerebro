### Output
> Great! The original Olympians were the children of Rhea and Cronus, Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, Poseidon, and Zeus. After Zeus overthrew Cronus and took over the role as the King of the Gods, the Olympians established their palace atop Mount Olympus, the highest mountain in Greece. Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades decided to draw lots in order to divide up the universe: the sea went to Poseidon, the sky to Zeus, and the underworld to Hades. Later, other gods and goddesses joined the ranks until there were twelve Olympians and fourteen Olympian gods. Which Olympian god or goddess would you like to learn more about?
