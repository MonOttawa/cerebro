### Output
> Hermes is the messenger god as well as the god of thieves, often described as mischievous and cunning. The child of Zeus and Maia (daughter of the Titan Atlas), Hermes stole fifty cows from Apollo the day he was born, and later, to pacify the angered god, gave him an instrument Hermes had just invented- the lyre. Hermes is often depicted as wearing winged sandals and a winged hat and carrying a caduceus.
