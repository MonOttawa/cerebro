### Output
> Apollo, also known as Phoebus Apollo, is the god of prophecy, medicine, music, and the sun. He is the child of Zeus and Leto and the twin of Artemis. Apollo&#039;s symbol is the lyre as well as the laurel. His sacred animals are the dolphin and the crow, among many others. His oracle is located at Delphi. In much of Greek mythology, Apollo is described as flying the sun-chariot across the sky, although this role was also filled by the child of Titan Hyperion, Helios.
