> Cool! Heracles, also known as Hercules, was the son of Zeus, best known for his 12 Labors, some of which include killing the nine-headed hydra, taming Cerberus, and slaying the Nemean Lion, whose hide he wore as a cape (learn more about his 12 Labors [here](https://www.theoi.com/articles/what-were-the-12-labors-of-hercules/)). Heracles was killed by his jealous wife who, worried that he might love another woman, covered his clothes in centaur&#039;s blood; the pain caused Heracles to kill himself. In death, Heracles received the honor of being allowed to live with the gods on Mount Olympus. Would you like to learn about another hero?
