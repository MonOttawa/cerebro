### Output
> Hades is the god of the underworld and the afterlife as well as wealth and is married to Persephone, the daughter of Demeter. A particularly important symbol of Hades is his helm of darkness, or his sacred animal, the ram. Hades rarely appears at Olympus over the course of Greek mythology, preferring instead to remain in his palace in the underworld. Although often called King of the Dead, Hades is not the god of death itself, that post being reserved for the god Thanatos.
