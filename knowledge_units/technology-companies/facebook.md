### Output
> Facebook is a very large company based in the United States that controls many social media platforms such as &quot;Facebook&quot; and &quot;WhatsApp&quot;. It was created by two students at Harvard university and there is a documentary that I really recommend on the creation of this firm called &quot;The social network&quot;, definitely a must watch!
