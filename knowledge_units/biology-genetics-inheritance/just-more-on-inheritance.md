### Output
> Okay, let&#039;s learn about a way we can show the inheritance of certain characteristics in a family. Pedigrees are charts that show a family tree and show how a certain trait is passed in the family. [This](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/high-school-biology/hs-classical-genetics/hs-pedigrees/v/pedigrees) is a link to a video that explains what pedigrees are and what they represent. Now that we&#039;ve learned all about how traits can be inherited, would you like to learn about how this relates to mutations?
