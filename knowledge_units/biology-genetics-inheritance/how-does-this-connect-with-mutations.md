### Output
> We&#039;ve learned all about how traits can be passed down from parent to offspring. Sometimes the traits passed down can be something as simple as eye color. However, at other times, if there are mutations in the chromosomes of a gamete that is fertilized, these genetic mutations can be passed along to offspring as well. These mutations can often cause diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, Huntington&#039;s, hemophilia, etc. If you would like to learn about how sceintists are working on changing these heritable mutations, click on the button below!
