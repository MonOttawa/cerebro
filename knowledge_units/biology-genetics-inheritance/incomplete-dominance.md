### Output
> Incomplete dominance is when no allele is dominant or recessive over the other - and instead they are mixed together in the organism&#039;s phenotype. For example, a flower with an allele for red petals and an allele for white petals may have pink petals. [Here](https://examples.yourdictionary.com/examples-of-incomplete-dominance.html) is a link to a webpage that gives lots of information and examples of incomplete dominance. What type of inheritance would you like to learn more about?
