### Output
> Co-dominance is a type of inheritance in which both of the alleles are expressed equally and neither is dominant or recessive to the other. For example, a flower who has an allele for red petals and white petals will have 2 red petals and 2 white petals (just a simplified example). [This](https://www.youtube.com/embed/_sWbQadFCso) is a video that explains co-dominance. What type of inheritance would you like to learn about next?
