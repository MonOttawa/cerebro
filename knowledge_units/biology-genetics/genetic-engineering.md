### Output
> Genetic engineering is the relatively new idea of altering an organism&#039;s characteristics by changing their DNA. However, the idea of selective breeding (breeding two organisms with desired traits) to create a favorable organism has existed for centuries. [This](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/high-school-biology/hs-molecular-genetics/hs-biotechnology/v/introduction-to-genetic-engineering) is a Khan Academy playlist that includes some videos and articles that go over the basics of genetic engineering.
