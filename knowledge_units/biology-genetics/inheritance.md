### Output
> Let&#039;s learn about how we inherit traits! First, we&#039;ll start by learning about very simple genetics, often callled Mendelian genetics. [This](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/biomolecules/mendelian-genetics/v/an-introduction-to-mendelian-genetics) is a link to a Khan Academy video that explains the basics of Mendelian &#039;Genetics.
