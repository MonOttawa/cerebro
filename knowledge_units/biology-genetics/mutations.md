### Alternatives:   Yes, I want to learn that! 
#### [:arrow_up: Go up](../../topics/biology-genetics.md)
### Current topic
> [Biology - Genetics](../../topics/biology-genetics.md)
### Output
> A mutation is a change in a DNA sequence. [This](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/gene-expression-and-regulation/mutations-ap/v/an-introduction-to-genetic-mutations) is a link to a Khan Academy video that describes mutations in depth. If you haven&#039;t learned about protein synthesis yet, you may want to check that out.
