### Output
> Many studies suggest that organic food may have some beneficial nutrients, such as more of certain vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. However, the evidence is not concluding. This is because the nutrient content of food depends on many factors, such as soil quality, weather conditions and when the crops are harvested. Same with dairy and meat, since its quality can be affected by differences in animal genetics and animal breed, how they are fed and where they are farmed. Would you like to know more about other benefits of organic food?
