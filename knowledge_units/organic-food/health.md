### Output
> There is not enough evidence available to prove that eating organic food is healthier than eating regular foods. However, some studies have indicated that the accumulation of pesticide exposure in our bodies due to numerous years of exposure could increase the risk of certain cancers and lead to health issues such as headaches, birth defects, added strain on weakened immune systems. In addition, some people with allergies to foods, chemicals, or preservatives often find their symptoms lessen or go away when they eat only organic foods. Would you like to know more about other benefits of organic food?
