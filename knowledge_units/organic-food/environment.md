### Output
> Many say organic food is better for the environment. On one hand, smaller-scale organic farming practices prohibit the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, this farming method reduces pollution of soils and watersheds, increase soil fertility, and use less energy. Farming without pesticides is also better for nearby animals and people who live close to farms. On the other hand, large-scale organic farms often require inputs generated off-site and don’t promote long-term sustainability. That being said, I found a video that suggests there’s not enough evidence about organic food being better for the environment and your health. You can watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/UnuP4vrLvc4) to learn why. Would you like to know more about other benefits of organic food?
