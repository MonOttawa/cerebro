### Output
> Veganism is often considered a lifestyle strongly anchored in animal rights. It’s a way of living where people choose to be environmentally friendly and animal-friendly by following a strict vegetarian diet. Vegans refrain from eating all animal products. This is, vegans don’t eat meat, eggs, dairy products or any animal-derived ingredients but a strict plant-based diet. Many vegans also do not eat foods that are processed using animal products, such as honey, and many also avoid purchasing clothing items containing silk, leather, wool or suede.
