### Output
> For both classical and acoustic guitars, the bigger the size is, the louder and fuller-sounding it will be. Classical guitar&#039;s shape has one shape, while acoustic guitars have a variety of shapes. Concert, auditorium, and jumbo are some examples of the acoustic guitars shape can be. Electric guitar can be any shape because the shape and size doesn&#039;t influence the sound.
