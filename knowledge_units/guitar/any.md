> Did you know that an electric guitar can be a taco? Because electric guitars are connected to an amplifier, the shape of it doesn&#039;t affect the sound. You can visit a picture of a taco electric guitar [here](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p05ln7jx.jpg). Acoustic guitars can be amplified as well depending on the design. You can visit this link where you can see some different shapes of acoustic guitars [here](https://guitariano.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/acoustic-guitar-body-shapes.jpg). On the side of the acoustic guitar, there can be a jack where you can place a cable in to connect the guitar to the amplifier. You can see an image [here](https://d1aeri3ty3izns.cloudfront.net/media/30/305236/1200/preview.jpg).
