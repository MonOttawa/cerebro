### Output
> Adolph Rickenbacker and George Beauchamp were the first people to create an electric guitar. First electric guitars were introduced in the 1930s. They used an amplifier to manipulate the shape of guitar tones. I have an awesome video explaining the basics of setting up an amplifier for your electric guitar.
