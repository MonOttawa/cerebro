### Output
> The nylon strings give a warmer and fuller sound when you play. These strings are softer, so when you play your fingertips don&#039;t hurt as much. I have a great photo of nylon strings. You can visit it [here](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-612899df1b3a4e7fd5aa3e76c4d24992.webp).
