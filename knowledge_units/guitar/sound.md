### Output
> Acoustic and classical guitars produce the sound the same way. The hollow body of the guitar is where it amplifies a specific frequency of sound that the strings vibrate. The electric guitar are filled with magnetic pickups. The steel strings, that are above the pickup, can connect the vibrating strings into an electrical signal. The electric guitar is connected to the amplifier with a cable.
