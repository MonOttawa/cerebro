### Output
> Anyone following a poorly planned diet is at risk of certain nutrient deficiencies. But a well-planned vegan diet that includes nutrient-rich whole and fortified foods can help provide adequate nutrient levels. This is especially important for children or women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Some studies show that vegans are at a higher risk of having inadequate blood levels of vitamin B12, vitamin D, long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, iron, iodine, zinc and calcium. Thatâ€™s why many vegans take supplements. Anyway, the best recommendation is always talk to a nutritionist or a doctor. Would you like to know more about veganism?
