### Output
> Vegan diets are richer in certain nutrients than an animal-based diet, such as fiber, antioxidants, minerals and vitamins. A few studies have reported that a plant-based diet has positive effects in people with different types of arthritis and osteoarthritis. It also appears to lower blood sugar levels and improve kidney function and it also may protect against certain cancers. Still, the best way to be healthy is following a healthy and balance diet and a healthy lifestyle. Would you like to know more about veganism?
