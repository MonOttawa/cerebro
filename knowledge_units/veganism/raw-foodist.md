### Output
> Raw foodists, also known as raw vegans, only consume fresh and uncooked vegan food, such as fruits, nuts, seeds and vegetables. Raw foodists only eat unprocessed vegan foods that have not been heated above 45ºC (115ºF) based on the belief that foods cooked above this temperature lose a significant amount of their nutritional value and become harmful to the body.
