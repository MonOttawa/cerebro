### Output
> Fruitarians are vegans that only eat fruits, nuts and seeds. Many fruitarians believe that it isn’t right for humans to eat seeds as they contain future plant. While many fruitarians also eat beans, lentils and peas, there are many who only eat what has fallen naturally from a plant or that can be gathered without harming the plant. Would you like to know more types of veganism?
