### Output
> Human activity is driving climate change. Industry, transportation, agriculture and other activities emit pollutants and other greenhouse gases that trap more of the Sun&#039;s heat and increase the Earth&#039;s temperature. Carbon dioxide has the greatest impact on climate change and humans have increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration by more than a third since the Industrial Revolution began. This gas and other pollutants persist in the atmosphere for a long period of time and it will take decades to remove them. Here&#039;s a [map](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/5294/production/_110504112_total_emissions_v2-nc.png) of the world&#039;s top emitters of carbon dioxide. Would you like to know more about climate change?
