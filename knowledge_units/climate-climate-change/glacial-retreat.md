### Output
> Glaciers are retreating almost everywhere around the world, either due to surface melting or ice breaking off glaciers. In addition, some studies reveal that the amount of spring snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere has decreased over the past 5 decades. Would you like to know more about climate change consequences?
