### Output
> Ecosystems are being destroyed by climate change. Animal and plant populations are already vanishing from their habitats because they&#039;re now too hot. All of these changes are shifting migrations and behaviour and driving these creatures to extinction if they don&#039;t adapt to survive. Would you like to know more about climate change consequences?
