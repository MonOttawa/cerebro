### Output
> The ocean absorbs most of the excess heat from greenhouse gas emissions, leading to rising ocean temperatures. Scientists have found that the average global sea surface temperature has increased by approximately 0.13°C (55.4ºF) per decade over the past 100 years. Would you like to know more about climate change consequences?
