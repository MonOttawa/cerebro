### Output
> Governments can make new policies  that encourage less waste and smarter use of our resources. Setting a price on carbon and other incentives for businesses and industries that become more energy efficient are useful ways to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide and other gases trapping heat on the planet. Moving to a carbon-free energy supply with renewable energies, protecting and restoring forests and seagrasses, and boosting the use of agricultural cover crops could help clean up significant amounts of carbon dioxide. Would you like to know more solutions?
