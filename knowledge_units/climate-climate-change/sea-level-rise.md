### Output
> Ice loss is one of the main contributors to sea levels rise. Actually, global sea levels are rising at a rate of 3.2 millimeters (0.13 inches) per year. Did you know this rate is nearly double that of the last century and is accelerating slightly every year? It&#039;s scary! Would you like to know more about climate change consequences?
