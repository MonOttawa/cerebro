### Output
> Well, the Sun is the fundamental source of energy that drives our climate system. Studies show that solar variability has played a role in past climate changes. However, scientists have concluded that solar irradiance is not the main cause of global warming and climate change, but the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere caused by human activity. Would you like to know more about it?
