### Output
> Many solutions come from humans, changing the way we behave, shifting the way we make and consume energy. These are 4 tips to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide humans add to the atmosphere:
1. Reduce and reuse things as much as possible.
2. Buy locally grown and in-season foods to reduce transportation emissions. Eat less meat and dairy to reduce livestock carbon dioxide footprint.
3. Unplug electronics when you&#039;re not using them use them and adjust heat and air conditioning consciously.
4. Use public transportation, walk or ride a bike.
