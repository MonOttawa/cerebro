### Current topic
> [Climate - Climate Change](../../topics/climate-climate-change.md)
### Output
> As more carbon dioxide is released by humans into the atmosphere, the  gas absorbed by the upper layer of the oceans increases, causing the water to become more acidic. This could pose major problems for coral reefs and other marine species and ecosystems. Would you like to know more about climate change consequences?
