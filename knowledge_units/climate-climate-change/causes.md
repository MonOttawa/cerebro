### Output
> The Earth is surrounded by an atmosphere made up of gases. When sun radiation enters our atmosphere, some of the sunâ€™s heat is trapped by the atmosphere and some bounces back out into space. This is known as the greenhouse effect and helps our atmosphere keep the Earth warm enough to live on. What do you think is the main cause of the global warming and climate change?
