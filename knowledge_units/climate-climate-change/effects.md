### Output
> The climate is changing, and most these changes are attributed to very small variations in Earthâ€™s orbit that change the amount of solar energy our planet receives. However, the current warming trend is 95% likely to be the result of human activity. The main concern is temperatures are now rising faster than at many other times. The data, collected by scientists over many years, reveals the signals of a changing climate. Let&#039;s talk about some of the main consequences of climate change.
