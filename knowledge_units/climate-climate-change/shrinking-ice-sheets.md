### Output
> The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass. Did you know that the rate of Antarctica ice mass loss has tripled in the last decade? Data recovered by NASA&#039;s scientist show Antarctica lost about 127 billion tons of ice per year between 1993 and 2016 while Greenland lost an average of 286 billion tons of ice per year during the same time period. In addition, both the extent and thickness of Arctic sea ice is declining faster over the last several decades. Would you like to know more about climate change consequences?
