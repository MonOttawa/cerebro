### Output
> Dissociative fugue, also known as psychogenic fugue or fugue state, is a really rare dissociative disorder. The word fugue comes from the Latin word &#039;fugere&#039;, which means &quot;to flee&quot;, because people who experience dissociative fugue will experience sudden desires to leave their home and unexpectedly travel. It is reversible amnesia, but during this time (which could last days, weeks, or months) the person will forget their previous identity and either create a new identity or just wander around, not remembering who they were. Would you like to know more about other dissociative disorders?
