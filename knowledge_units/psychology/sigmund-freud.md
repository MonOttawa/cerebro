> Austrian neurologist Sigmund Freud is very well-known in the world of psychology because he was the founder of psychoanalysis. Psychoanalysis is a method of treatment for mental disorders. What Sigmund Freud did was create a kind of in-depth talk therapy that helps reveal unconscious thoughts and bring in thoughts that can be brought to the surface. It is based on the fact that often people don&#039;t know their thoughts that are buried and that makes the thoughts unconscious. The goal of psychoanalysis is to bring up those thoughts and find out the truth. Along with that, Feud also used the terms of &#039;id, ego, and superego. Id would be the unconscious personality in a person that is based on needs and desires. Then there is the superego, and in the superego,  we are fully conscious of what we are doing and we listen to our moral conscience. Finally, there is the ego, that lies between both. Ego is basically defined as the way you look at yourself. Freud&#039;s theory changed the way we saw the mind, and it still has an impact on us to this day.
