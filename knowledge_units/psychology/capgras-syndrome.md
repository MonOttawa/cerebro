### Output
> Capgras syndrome is a very interesting disorder. Also known as Capgras delusion or imposter syndrome, this disorder causes someone to believe that a friend or family member has been replaced by an impostor. It is usually found in people with Alzheimer&#039;s, Schizophrenia, or dementia, and unfortunately, there is no standard treatment to cure people who are affected by the syndrome. In one case, a woman refused to believe that the child in front of her was her daughter, and she claimed that her 9-year-old daughter, Sarah, was actually placed in Child Protective Services and replaced by an imposter.
