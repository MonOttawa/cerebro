### Output
> Dissociative Depersonalization, also known as dissociative derealization, is a disorder that is caused by stress or trauma. People who experience this type of dissociative disorder often feel like they are disconnected from their own body, and they will often feel detached from their surroundings, making it seem like they are outside observers of their own life. There is no cure for this, however, there are treatments that reduce distressing symptoms. Would you like to know more about other dissociative disorders?
