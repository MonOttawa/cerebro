### Output
> Habituation is a process in which a response to a stimulus is decreased after being repeatedly exposed to it. So, for example, imagine you are hearing a very annoying ringtone. At the start, this new noise will annoy you, but over time, you get used to it. The reason why you get used to this is because, after repeated exposure, the response to that stimulus is decreasing.
