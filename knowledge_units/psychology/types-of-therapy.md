### Output
> There are so many types of therapy. Of course, there are different ones for different situations, but there are at least 10 main types: First, there is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), and psychodynamic therapy, which are the most common types of therapy. Then there is also Psychoanalytic Therapy, Play therapy, Psychotherapy for parents and children, Interpersonal therapy, group or family therapy, emotion-focused therapy, and finally, Dialectal Behavioral Therapy (DBT). There are several more, but these are the main types. As mentioned before, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and psychodynamic therapy are the most common types of therapy. CBT focuses on finding and correcting distorted thinking, and psychodynamic therapy works on the cause of the behavior, not the symptoms. 
Some types of therapy work better for specific problems, for example, with CBT, medical interventions could be put in play, and things like antipsychotics, antidepressants, or even ECT are given to the person in need of therapy. (Of course, there is always the option of using the placebo effect on a patient, since it has been found that as long as there are expectations of a pill, a fake pill will work on people anyways! So the patients are given &#039;fake&#039; antidepressants on purpose, but since the patients don&#039;t know about it, the same outcome takes place, and the placebo works!)
Would you like to know more about psychology?
(If you are keen on learning more about psychoanalysis, I would recommend looking at Sigmund Freud and his theory!)
