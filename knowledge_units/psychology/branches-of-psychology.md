### Current topic

### Output
> There are several types of psychology. There is clinical psychology, developmental psychology, cognitive psychology, evolutionary psychology, forensic psychology, health psychology, sports psychology, criminal psychology, neuropsychology, occupational psychology, social psychology... Every branch of psychology works on a different aspect in relation to the mind and the behavior that comes with it. Without all these different branches, we wouldn&#039;t discover so much. To this day there are still many unanswered questions and things we are trying to discover, but it just takes time. Not long ago we had the debate between dualism and materialism. Nature or nurture? What about the mind and body debate? Is the mind a part of the body or is the body a part of the mind? Is there such a thing as free will? What about moral debates? Is it correct to test humans? Is it correct to test animals? There are all these questions that will be answered one day.
Would you like to know more about psychology?
