### Output
> Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), previously known as Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD), is a disorder that typically occurs after severe trauma during childhood. This disorder is known to be characterized by an involuntary escape from reality, which explains why you lose connections between thoughts, identity, consciousness, and memory. People who have DID usually experience memory loss, out-of-body experiences (as if you were watching a movie of yourself), depression or anxiety,  not much sense of self-identity, and emotional numbness. To cure DID, cognitive-behavioral therapies, dialectical behavioral therapy, and medication all help. Would you like to know more about other dissociative disorders?
