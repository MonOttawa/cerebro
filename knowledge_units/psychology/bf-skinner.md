### Output
> B.F Skinner is mostly known for the theory of Behaviorism. Also known as Behavioral psychology, this theory basically shows the idea of learning based on the idea that all behaviors are obtained by conditioning (classical and operant conditioning). It also has to do with the idea that Behaviorists believe that responses to environmental stimuli determine our actions, which also means that behaviorism is mainly looking for observable aspects, not things like thinking or emotion that isn&#039;t visible. Regarding Skinner, he looked at operant conditioning and determined that changes in behavior are caused by a person&#039;s response to situations that happen in the environment. Other famous psychologists like Ivan Pavlov, Edward Thorndike (the real founding father of Operant Conditioning), and John B. Watson (the founding father of behaviorism) all worked on the behaviorist theory.
