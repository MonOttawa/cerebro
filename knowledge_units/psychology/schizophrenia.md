> Schizophrenia is a mental disorder in which people experience hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking and behavior. Although we still don&#039;t know the exact cause of schizophrenia, we do know that it is treatable. Although schizophrenia stands for &quot;split&quot; + &quot;mind&quot;, it is NOT a multiple personality disorder, contrary to a few people&#039;s beliefs.
