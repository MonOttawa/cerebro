### Output
> There are so many materials and techniques used in sculpture. My favorite one is &quot;Apollo and Daphne&quot;, a life-sized Baroque marble sculpture by Bernini, executed between 1622-1625. Check it [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Apollo_and_Daphne_%28Bernini%29.jpg). Would you like to talk about something else?
