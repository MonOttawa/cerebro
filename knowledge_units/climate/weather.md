### Output
> What&#039;s the weather like today? That&#039;s a real question. Weather refers to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, but forecasts aren&#039;t always reliable, are they? How many times have you gone outside expecting a sunny day that has later been crashed by a sudden storm? Well, that&#039;s because weather is more complicated than we think. Would you like to know more about weather?
