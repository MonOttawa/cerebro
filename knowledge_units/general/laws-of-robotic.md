### Output
> Let me think... First, a robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. Second, a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. And third, a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.
