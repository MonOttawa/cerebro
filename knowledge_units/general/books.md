### Output
> I consider books to be a great source for imagination, I love that about them! We&#039;ve got them in paper and we also have electronic books but it wasn&#039;t always like this. Here&#039;s a little [video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/1G1RVRmfs-I) to learn about the evolution of books. Also, did you know that the pioneer of the e-book was a Spanish teacher? Her name was Ángela Ruiz Robles and she developed the prototype of a mechanical encyclopedia in 1949. Do you prefer fiction or non-fiction books?
