### Output
> Music is one of the things I love most, as it involves emotions and creativity. Did you know that out of all the members of the &quot;Beatles&quot;, none of them knew how to read or write music? My favorite instrument is guitar. I&#039;d love to share with you some great things about it. Would you like it?
