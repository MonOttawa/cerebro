### Output
> The Polar climate is characterized by low temperatures and precipitation. It’s so cold that even in summer, the temperatures never go higher than 10°C (50°F). There are two subtypes: Tundra, where winters are long and cold and there are some places in the Arctic Circle where, for at least one day in the year, the Sun does not rise; and Snow and ice climate, with temperatures below freezing throughout the year. Would you like to know more about climate groups?
