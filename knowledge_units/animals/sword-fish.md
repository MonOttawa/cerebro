These migrate from one place to another and ae mostly found in tropical and temperate parts of Indian Oceans, Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean. If you dive 550m down, you can find sword fish. The sword fish are called this because it has a sword-like spear to kill prey and it makes it easier to eat. Because humans hunt these fishes, they only live for about nine years.
