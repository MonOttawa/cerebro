> Snow leopards live up in a craggy rock ledge in the peaks of Mongolia, a country in Asia. These endangered cats are nearly impossible to see—they’ve even earned the nickname “ghost of the mountains.” Their spotted coats act as cloaks of invisibility by blending into the rocky mountains of the 12 Central Asian countries where the cats live: Afghanistan, Bhutan, China, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. [Here](https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/snow-leopard) is an awesome article discussing more about snow leopards.
