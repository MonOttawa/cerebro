### Output
> Spider monkeys have long, thin arms with hooklike hands that allow them to swing through the trees. They do not have opposable thumbs. The brown-headed spider monkey lives in a large community of about 20 to 100 male and female monkeys. They split into smaller groups for feeding. Females usually give birth to only a single baby each year or two. [Here](https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/black-spider-monkey) is an awesome link to read more about spider monkeys.
