> Most people think of leopards prowling the savannas of Africa, but these spotted predators thrive in many different countries and habitats. Amur leopards can be found in the mountainous forests of eastern Russia and northern China. Named after the Amur River, a body of water that runs along the border of both countries, these cats are well adapted to this harsh environment. [Here](https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/amur-leopard) is a cool link you should check out.
