> Did you know that the yellow-footed rock wallaby is a marsupial—a pouched mammal—belonging to the same family as the kangaroo? The yellow-footed rock wallaby moves easily around mountaintops, jumping as far as 13 feet (four meters) from rock to rock and even scaling cliffs and climbing trees. In the hot Australian summers, the wallaby is active only at night, while in the winter it can sometimes be seen sunbathing on the rocks. [Here](https://www.australianwildlife.org/wildlife/yellow-footed-rock-wallaby/) is an awesome article talking more about yellow-footed rock wallaby.
