### Output
> Wolverines are large, stocky animals that look like small bears, but they are the largest members of the weasel family. Their feet are wide and furred, webbed, and front feet have long, strong claws, which help them climb. They often follow wolves to scavenge the remains of their prey. Wolverines&#039; thick fur is brown with two yellowish stripes on back. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/embed/9KeDxJEc0rU) is an awesome video talking more about wolverine.
