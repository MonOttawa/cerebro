### Output
> White-handed gibbons are small tailless apes with soft, thick fur. They live in trees and like to stay high up in the canopy of trees. Their very long arms allow them to swing effortlessly among the tree branches. They can also change direction in a split second, and can catch birds in midair and eat them after landing. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/embed/C6HucIWKsVc) is an awesome video talking more about white-handed gibbon.
