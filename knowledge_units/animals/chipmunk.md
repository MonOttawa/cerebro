### Output
> Chipmunks are part of the squirrel family, and while they look similar to their bushy-tailed cousins, chipmunks are actually smaller, with alternating light and dark stripes along their cheeks and backs. Theyâ€™re 25 species of chipmunk and 24 of which live in North America. They are great climbers and swimmers and can live in a variety of habitats. These species like to live alone. They live in burrows called dens. Chipmunks hibernate in the winter and spends most of the winter sleeping in their dens.
