### Output
> Howler monkeys are the loudest of all monkeys. They call to let others know where their territory is, alerting them to stay away. Their calls sounds like a loud whooping bark or roar. After one group of howlers call, another group answers. Howler monkeys usually do this in the morning and at the end of the day. They are omnivores and can live up to 15 to 20 years in the wild. Central and South America is the home of howler monkeys. [Here](https://nationalzoo.si.edu/animals/black-howler-monkey) is a link about these loud creatures.
