### Output
> Guanacos are graceful animals and have large heads, very long necks, and big, pointed ears. They’re slender animals with pale brown backs white undersides, and short tails. These species are related to camels, as are vicunas, llamas, and alpacas. But they live in South America, while camels are found in Africa and Asia. Guanacos and vicunas are wild animals, but llamas and alpacas have been domesticated and were probably bred from guanacos. [Here](https://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/guanaco) is a cool website about guanacos.
