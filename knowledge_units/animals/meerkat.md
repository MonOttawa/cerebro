### Output
> There are few animals on Earth who work as well together as meerkats. These squirrel-size members of the mongoose family live in groups as large as 40, and everyone in the mob participates in gathering food, keeping a look out for predators, and taking care of the babies. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/embed/D8JKXlTY70g) is a neat video about meerkats.
