> The mountain lion goes by many names, including cougar, catamount, panther, red tiger, deer tiger, and puma. This cat can be found throughout much of South and North America. The mountain lion used to be found all over the United States, but now is primarily seen in the western U.S. An endangered subspecies of mountain lion also remains in Florida. [Here](https://www.nwf.org/Educational-Resources/Wildlife-Guide/Mammals/Mountain-Lion) is an awesome link talking more about mountain lions.
