> Wolves live in groups called packs. A pack is a family of seven to eight wolves with a mom, dad, and offspring. The wolves&#039; communication skills are very important to the pack&#039;s survival. They work together to hunt, raise their young, and protect their territory. They are carnivores and the average life span in the wild is 6 to 8 years. Wolves communicate with howls, whimpers, whine, growl and bark, yelp, and snarl. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/embed/VYKsI5ILiaQ) is a cool video about these cool species.
