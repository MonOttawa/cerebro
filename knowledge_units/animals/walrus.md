> Walruses have long tusks and a prominent mustache. These large marine mammals are found near the Arctic Circle. They are extremely social and snort and bellow loudly at their companions. During the mating season they are quite aggressive. They are carnivores and can live up to 40 years. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/embed/lJGcrlHmsps) is an awesome video about walrus.
