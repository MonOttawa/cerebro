> Did you know that these drowsy tree-dwellers sleep up to 20 hours a day? Even when they are awake, they barely move at all. In fact, they&#039;re so incredibly sluggish, algae actually grows on their fur. Sloths live in the tropical forests of Central and South America. With their long arms and shaggy fur, they resemble monkeys, but they are actually related to armadillos and anteaters. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/embed/DpV4k3Edr-I) is an awesome video talking about sloths.
