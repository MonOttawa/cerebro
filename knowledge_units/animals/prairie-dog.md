### Output
> Prairie dogs may bark like dogs, that&#039;s how they got their name, but the little guys are rodents, not canines. They have sharp claws that allow them to dig well and have excellent vision and hearing. With this ability they can detect predators like snakes when they are above ground. [Here](https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/8-surprising-prairie-dog-facts) is a nice article talking about prairie dogs.
