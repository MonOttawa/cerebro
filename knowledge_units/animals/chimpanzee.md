> Wild chimpanzees live in Africa. Did you know that chimpanzees are able to make tools? Did you also know that humans and chimpanzees share about 95 to 98 percent of the same DNA? Chimpanzees have thumbs that help them to make tool and hold on to objects. Also chimpanzees groom each other to calm nerves or tense chimpanzees. [Here](https://www.janegoodall.org.uk/chimpanzees/chimpanzee-central/15-chimpanzees/chimpanzee-central/21-chimp-facts) is a website where you can learn more about these creatures.
