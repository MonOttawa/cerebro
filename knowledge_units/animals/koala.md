> Koalas are marsupials, related to kangaroos. They are herbivores and live for about 20 years. Most marsupials (koalas) have pouches where the tiny newborns develop. Did you know that a newborn koala is only the size of a jelly bean? [Here](https://www.youtube.com/embed/oI3ADcDH0Uc) is a nice video about koalas.
