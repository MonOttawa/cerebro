### Output
> Sea otters are part of the weasel family. They have webbed feet, water-repellent fur to keep them dry and warm, and nostrils and ears that close in the water. They can live up to 23 years. Sea otters often float at the water&#039;s surface in forests of kelp, or giant seaweed, and entangle themselves to keep from moving in the rolling sea. [Here](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/s/sea-otter/) is an awesome website talking about sea otters.
