> Did you know that harp seals spend most of their time diving and swimming in the icy waters of the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans? These sleek swimmers often hunt for fish and crustaceans at 300 feet (90 meters) and are able to dive nearly 1,000 feet (300 meters). They are can remain submerged for up to 15 minutes! The average life span in the wild is 20 years. Harp seals can also be referred to as saddleback seals because of the dar, saddle-like marking on the back and sides of their light yellow and gray bodies of the adults. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/embed/BF2TZq-ntRQ) is a cool video about these incredible creatures.
