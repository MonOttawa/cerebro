### Output
> River otters generally live along rivers, as their name implies, but they&#039;re also found near streams and lakes. They prefer water bordered by woods and with wetlands, such as marshes, nearby. Flexing their long bodies up and down, paddling with their webbed hind feet, and using their feet and strong tails to steer, river otters are underwater acrobats. They can stay underwater for up to four minutes. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/embed/rN1zcU-xHrI) is an awesome video about these otters.
