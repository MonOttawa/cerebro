### Output
> Did you know that the hippo’s nose, ears, and eyes are at the top of its head so they can protrude from the water while the rest of the hippo’s body is below the surface? This allows them to still hear, sea and breath. They are excellent swimmers and can hold their breathe for 5 minutes underwater. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/embed/ks_P46IZCxk) is a cool video on hippopotamus.
