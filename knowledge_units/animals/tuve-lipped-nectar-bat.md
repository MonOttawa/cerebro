> Did you know that the tuve-lipped nectar bat from Ecuador was first described in 2005? The species name fistulata is derived from the Latin word fistula, meaning &quot;tube&quot;. It refers to the bat&#039;s lower lip, which extends 3.3â€“4.8 mm beyond the upper lip and is rolled into a funnel shape. The exact function of the tube-lip is unknown. The bat has the longest tongue (8.5 cm) relative to its body size of any mammal. Its tongue is 150% the size of its overall body length. [Here](https://thekidshouldseethis.com/post/24682087674) is an awesome article discussing more about this species.
