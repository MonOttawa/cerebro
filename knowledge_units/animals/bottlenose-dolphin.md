### Output
> These creatures are some of the smartest animals on Earth. They can send messages to one another in many different ways. They squeak, squawk, and use body language to communicate. Did you know that they can jump up to 20 feet in the air? Each dolphin has a special whistle thatâ€™s created when they are born. They live in the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, and Indian Ocean. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/embed/VjMn_dVCJyA) is an awesome video on these dolphins.
