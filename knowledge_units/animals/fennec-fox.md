### Output
> The fennec fox is the smallest of all the world&#039;s foxes, weighing only 2.2 pounds (1 kilogram). It has enormous ears, measuring 6 inches (15 centimeters), which it appears to have borrowed from a much bigger relative. These species can also be called desert foxes because they live in desert zones of North Africa and the Sinai and Arabian peninsulas.
