### Output
> Hedgehogs have prickly spines everywhere except on their face, legs, and bellies. When they curl up in a tight ball and tuck their heads, tail, and legs, they can protect themselves. They are often compared to pincushions, hedgehogs depend on their spines for defense, both while they sleep and when they face enemies. They are carnivores and they live in some parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa. [Here](https://www.awf.org/wildlife-conservation/hedgehog) is a cool website about hedgehogs.
