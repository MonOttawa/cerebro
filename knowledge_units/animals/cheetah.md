> Did you know that cheetahs are not able to roar? A female cheetah can have up to 6 cubs and sometimes even 8 cubs but that is rare. Cheetahs are also the only animals that have “tear marks” that run from the eye to the mouth that help them to see better with the blinding light of the sun. Did you know that cheetahs are also good at  jumping far? They can jump as far as 20 feet which is about 10 times their body length. Cheetahs can run up to a speed of 60 to 70 mph. Cheetahs were built to hunt and speed. Cheetahs live in Africa.
