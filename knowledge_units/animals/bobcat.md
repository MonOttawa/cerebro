> Bobcats may look cute and cuddly, but these felines that live throughout North America are actually fierce predators. They can leap as far as 12 feet to catch prey and have been known to take down much larger animals, such as young deer. They are carnivores and can live up to 10 to 12 years. If you would like to learn more about these animals [here](https://nationalzoo.si.edu/animals/bobcat) is a cool website you should check out.
