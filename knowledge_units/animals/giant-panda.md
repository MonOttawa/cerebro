### Output
> Pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo shoots and leaves. Occasionally they eat other vegetation, fish, or small animals, but bamboo accounts for 99 percent of their diets. Did you know that pandas eat fast. You can only find these giant pandas in a certain part of Asia. Pandas are actually shy and they donâ€™t venture into areas where people live. This restricts pandas to very limited areas. [Here](https://nationalzoo.si.edu/animals/giant-panda) is a cool website you should check out.
