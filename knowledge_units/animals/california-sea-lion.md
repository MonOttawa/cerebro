### Output
> California sea lions live on the western coast of North America from the Baja California peninsula in Mexico to British Columbia. These semi-aquatic mammals feed on fish, squid, and shellfish. They are generally found in open water, where they prefer to fish, but are sometimes found in rivers near the coast as well. They are carnivores and the average life span in the wild is up to 30 years. Did you know that these sea lions are intelligent and social species? [Here](https://www.youtube.com/embed/KTpnBCMdpPQ) is a cool video on these species.
