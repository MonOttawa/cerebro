### Output
> Duck-billed platypuses are small, shy animals. Their heads and body are flattened. This helps them glide through the water. Their dark brown fur is thick and repels water to keep them warm and dry even after hours of swimming. These species have remarkable snout. They are soft and are covered with thousands of receptors that help the platypus detect prey. You can only find these species only on the east coast of Australia. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/embed/b-gEx-yFz1c) is a cool video about these creatures.
