### Output
> Red pandas and giant pandas share a similar name and a love for bamboo but they arenâ€™t closely related. Scientists think that red pandas are more closely related to weasels, raccoons, and skunks. 
Did you know that red pandas spend about 90 percent of their time in the trees in the misty mountains of Nepal, Myanmar, and central China where they live. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/embed/wO0Glc99nZ8) is a nice video discussing more about red pandas.
