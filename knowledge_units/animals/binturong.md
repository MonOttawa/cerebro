### Output
> Binturongs live in the rainforests of Southeast Asia. They belong to a family of carnivorous mammals that also includes civets. The animals spend most of their time hanging out in the treetops. When they aren’t lounging on branches, they’re looking for yummy snacks such as insects, birds, and fruit. [Here](https://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/binturong) is a cool website about binturong.
