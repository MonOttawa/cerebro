> Did you know that each zebra has its own unique pattern of distinctive stripes, just as humans have their own unique pattern of fingerprints? Zebras stick together in herds, but within a herd, zebras tend to stay together in smaller family groups. Zebras are constantly on the move to find fresh grass and water. Sometimes they gather in huge herds of thousands as they migrate to better feeding grounds. They often travel in mixed herds with other grazers and browsers, such as wildebeest.
