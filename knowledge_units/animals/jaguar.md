> Did you know that jaguars are the largest of South America&#039;s big cats and the third largest cats in the world? Their fur is usually tan or orange with black spots, called &quot;rosettes&quot; because they are shaped like roses, but some jaguars are so dark they don&#039;t seem to have spots. They are carnivores and can live between 12 to 15 years in the wild. Jaguars do not avoid water, in fact they are good swimmers. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/embed/tx6r7QX2iXk) is an awesome video on jaguars.
