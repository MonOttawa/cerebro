### Output
> Aye-ayes can be found only in the forests of Madagascar, an island nation off the coast of Africa. The animals rarely descend from their treetop digs to the forest floor. Only active at night, they spend the day snoozing on branches in nests made of leaves. When darkness falls the creatures forage for food in the treetops. In addition to bugs, aye-ayes feast on fruit such as mango, scooping pulp from the juicy meal with their bony fingers.
