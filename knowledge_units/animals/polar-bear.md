> Did you know that polar bears have blubber under their fur that is black? This helps them to say warm when it is cold because the sun radiates light to the blubber keeping them warm. Also, their large paws help them to swim better. Male polar bears can weigh up to 800kg and can be twice as big as females. One other cool fact is that they have a good sense of smell so they can find seal air holes and can even smell the seal from a metre of snow. [Here](https://www.wwf.org.uk/learn/fascinating-facts/polar-bears) is a nice link talking more about polar bears.
