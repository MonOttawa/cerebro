### Output
> Charadriiformes is one of the very most extensive bird orders. There are about 350 bird species in it. Surprisingly, these birds have varied in size from 0.006 to 4.4 pounds. As the name suggests, shorebirds live near the water: in wetlands, freshwater and seawater shorelines, sometimes near the ocean. Some examples of shorebirds include Great auk, Crested Auklet, Horned puffin, and African Jacana.
