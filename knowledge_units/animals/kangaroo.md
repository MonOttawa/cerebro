Kangaroos belong to the animal family Macropus, literally &quot;big foot.&quot; Did you know that because they have strong legs they can leap about 30 feet 9 meters) in one single bound? They can travel more than 30 miles (48 kilometers) per hour. [Here](https://www.livescience.com/27400-kangaroos.html) is a nice link about kangaroos.
