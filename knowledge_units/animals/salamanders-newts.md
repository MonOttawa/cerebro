### Output
> Salamanders and newts are not exactly the same thing. Newts are a type of salamander. Essentially, all newts are salamanders, but not all salamanders are newts. Most newts have webbed feet and a paddle-like tail, which make it easier to live in the water. Salamanders have lizard-like appearance. I have a wonderful website that talks more about salamanders and newts [here](https://www.livescience.com/58396-newt-facts.html). Would you like to know more about amphibians?
