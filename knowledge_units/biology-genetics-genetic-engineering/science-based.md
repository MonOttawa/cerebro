### Output
> A common type of genetic engineering in our modern world is called CRISPR, which stands for “clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats”. [This](https://www.youtube.com/embed/6tw_JVz_IEc) is a video that explains the basics of CRISPR. Let&#039;s learn more about CRISPR together! Or, if you want to learn about old types of genetic engineering first, you can too!
