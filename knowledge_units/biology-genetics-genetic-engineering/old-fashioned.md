### Output
> While the idea of biotechnology is relatively new, the idea of breeding organisms with desirable traits is not. Humans have been selectively breeding organisms for many, many years. [Here](https://www.yourgenome.org/facts/what-is-selective-breeding) is an article that explains what selective breeding is. Now that we&#039;ve learned about an old type of genetic engineering, would you like to learn about the modern  and scientific ways we can genetically engineer DNA?
