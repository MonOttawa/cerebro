### Output
> Now that we&#039;ve learned the basics of CRISPR and what it is, we can begin to understand how it works. Let&#039;s watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/embed/2pp17E4E-O8) video together. It explains how CRISPR is used to edit DNA. Also, we can read [this](https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/explainer-how-crispr-works) article that explains CRISPR as well. Would you like to keep learning about genetic engineering?
