### Current topic
> [Biology - Genetics - Genetic Engineering](../../topics/biology-genetics-genetic-engineering.md)
### Output
> Biotechnology includes topics such as genetic engineering, gel electrophoresis, and PCR. [This](https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZDZUAleWX78) is a video that explains gel electrophoresis. And [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/high-school-biology/hs-molecular-genetics/hs-biotechnology/v/the-polymerase-chain-reaction-pcr) is a video that explains what PCR is. Now that we&#039;ve learned all about genetic engineering and biotechnology, what would you like to learn about?
