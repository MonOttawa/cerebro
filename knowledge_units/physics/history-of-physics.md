### Output
> I love this topic. Physics is the study of matter and energy and how they interact with everything. It was invented by Isaac Newton. He is commonly known as the man who saw an apple fall from a tree, and then invented the theory of gravity. It was first used to try to understand things about why things happen in our everyday lives; however, nowadays with the advancements made, we are able to predict/solve almost all of our inquiries. Would you like to know more about physics?
