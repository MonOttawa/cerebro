### Output
> Physics is all around us at all times. Thanks to physics we can tell what energy is and how it affects us from the Earth&#039;s rotation to powering me by charging your electronic device. Some cool things we can calculate are how much we would weigh in mars by multiplying our mass times the gravitational force (3.711 m/sÂ²). Or simply how long we have to wait for our hot coffee to cool down so we can drink it. Would you like to know more about physics?
