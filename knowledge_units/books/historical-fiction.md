### Output
> Historical Fiction uses real historical events but its characters and some details of the story are imaginary. An example of this genre can be found in The Nightingale, written by Kristin Hannah and published in 2015, which is inspired in real-life facts of AndrÃ©e de Jongh, a member of the Belgian Resistance during the Second World War. Another example is The Book Thief by Markus Zusak, published in 2005. This novel was adapted into a film released in 2013. You can watch the trailer [here](https://www.youtube.com/embed/92EBSmxinus).
