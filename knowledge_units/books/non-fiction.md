### Output
> Non-fiction books represent real events truthfully and accurately. A Brief History of Time, by Stephen Hawking (1988) or Bad Blood, by Lorna Sage (2000) are examples of this genre. The former is a text of
scientific disclosure and the later is a literary memoir. Would you like to keep discussing books?
