> To go out with friends to party it is very fashionable for women to wear short dresses in colours like black or dark blue. Also an elegant top and a skirt or jeans always looks good. If you want to add some fun wear clothes with sequins. For men a shirt and some long plain trousers looks elegant and very on trend. Would you like to know more about fashion?
