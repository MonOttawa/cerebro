### Output
> To go to work we must look formal while feeling comfortable. In this case a blazer and some long trousers for both men are women are ideal! But it also depends on where you work. Some companies prefer to not have a dress code. This is common in startups, where people dress mostly casual. I believe skills, knowledge and competences are not defined by what you wear ðŸ˜€. Would you like to know more about fashion?
