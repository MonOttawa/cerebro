### Output
> Phineas Gage is most probably the most famous patient in neuroscience. In September of 1848, Phineas was working on blasting rock to clear the space for a roadbed for a railroad in Vermont, when suddenly, something went wrong and the tamping iron ended up being driven up the left side of his face, passing behind his left eye, and going through the left part of his brain. Despite the injury, Gage managed to walk with little assistance, to the hospital. Miraculously, once the surgery was over, Gage did not die. He didn&#039;t lose his memory, he didn&#039;t motor or speech impairments, but what did occur, was a personality change. After the accident, people described him by saying that he was &quot;no longer Gage&quot;. His friends said that he became disrespectful, restless, and unreliable. This occurred because both the left and right prefrontal cortices (the part of the brain involved in emotional processing and rational decision-making) were injured. Astoundingly, Gage lived for twelve more years, before he died from Status epilepticus at the age of 36. His case was very important in the neuroscience department because it proved that the frontal lobe was indeed in charge of personality.
