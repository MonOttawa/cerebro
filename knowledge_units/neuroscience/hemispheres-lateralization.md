### Output
> The brain is composed of two hemispheres: The left and the right hemispheres. Both hemispheres are separated by a longitudinal fissure, but they connect by a bundle of nerve fibers called the corpus callosum. Although the hemispheres aren&#039;t completely symmetrical, they both are extremely similar. The left hemisphere controls the right part of the body, and the right hemisphere controls the left part of the body. While the left hemisphere is usually in charge of logic, language, and reasoning, the right hemisphere is mostly in charge of creativity, imagination, and intuition.
