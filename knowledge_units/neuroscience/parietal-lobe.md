### Output
> The parietal lobe is located behind the frontal lobe and central sulcus* and on top of the temporal lobe. This lobe is in charge of several things, but integrating sensory information from different parts of the body, relations between numbers, and the manipulation of objects all fall into the category of the main functions. It also processes information with regards to the sense of touch. Damage to this lobe could result in aphasia, agraphia, agnosia, and/or acalculia. What else would you like to talk about?

*The central sulcus is the sulcus separating the frontal and parietal lobes.
