### Output
> The spinal cord is really important because it connects the peripheral nervous system to the brain, and it sends nerve impulses to the brain! The spinal cord is protected by the spinal column (vertebrae), and there are five main regions. There is the cervical region, the thoracic region, the lumbar region, the sacral region, and finally, the coccygeal region. What else would you like to know about neuroscience?
