### Output
> Neurons and Glial Cells are the most common cells in the brain. Neurons are important because they process and transmit information through electrical and chemical signals, and, in turn, the glial cells provide insulation and protection for the neurons, and they maintain homeostasis and form myelin. Would you like to learn more about neurons or glia?
