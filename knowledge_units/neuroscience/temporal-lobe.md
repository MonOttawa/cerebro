### Output
> Temporal means &quot;near the temples&quot;, which is where this lobe is located in a human brain. The temporal lobe is involved in many things, but the main one would be auditory perception. This lobe also holds the primary auditory cortex. This lobe is mainly composed of three parallel gyri (superior, middle, and inferior temporal gyri) and two sulci (superior and inferior temporal sulci). If you damage your temporal lobe you could experience hearing loss, the inability to recognize faces, and disorders of visual perception. Would you like to learn about any other lobe?
