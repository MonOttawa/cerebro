### Output
> The frontal lobe is the biggest lobe in the brain. It is in charge of reasoning, problem-solving, emotional expression, language, judgment, and many more things. The frontal lobe is considered to be the &quot;control panel&quot; of our personality. If it is damaged, your ability to make good choices or recognize the consequences are often weakened. There is a very interesting story about a man named Phineas Gage. He damaged most of his frontal lobe when an iron rod was driven through his skull. Would you like to know what happened to him?
