### Output
> The cerebellum is the part behind the top part of the brain stem. It is in charge of posture, balance, coordination, and speech, eye movements... The cerebellum is important for motor learning and it plays an important role in physical movement. In Latin, the cerebellum means &quot;the little brain&quot;, because the cerebellum is so similar to the cerebrum (the main portion of the brain). What else would you like to talk about?
