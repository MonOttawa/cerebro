### Output
> I find Einstein&#039;s brain fascinating! Did you know that Albert Einstein&#039;s brain was actually stolen when he died? A man named Dr. Thomas Stoltz Harvey stole it during Einstein&#039;s autopsy, and then he fled to Philadelphia and split the brain into 240 sections and sent them to researchers around the world! There are still parts of Einstein&#039;s brain missing to this day! Would you like to know more about neuroscience?
