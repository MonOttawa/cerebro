### Output
> The occipital lobe is the smallest of the four lobes. The job of the occipital lobe is to process and interpret everything we see. It is located at the very back of the cerebral cortex (posterior/caudal part of the brain). This lobe analyzes shapes, movement, colors, and many more. Damage to this lobe could result in severe vision loss, total blindness,  inability to identify colors, and visual hallucinations. What else would you like to know about the brain?
