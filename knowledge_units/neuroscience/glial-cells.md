### Output
> Glial Cells are non-neuronal cells that don&#039;t produce electrical impulses. They act as protectors and protect and insulate the neurons. As a matter of fact, there are even more glial cells than neurons (85 billion glia!). There are six main types of glia: the astrocytes, the oligodendrocytes, the microglia, the ependymal cells, the Schwann cells, and the satellite cells, and they all have different functions. Without glial cells, synapses wouldn&#039;t work properly! What else would you like to talk about?
