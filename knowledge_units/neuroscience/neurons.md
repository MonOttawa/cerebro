### Output
> Neurons, also known as nerve or brain cells, are the most important cells in the brain, and most probably the most important in the body. There are 86 billion neurons in your brain, and there are four different types of neurons: unipolar, bipolar, multipolar, and pseudounipolar. Neurons are mainly composed of three parts: the dendrites, which receive information from other neurons, the axons which conduct electrical impulses away from the cell body of the neuron (the soma), and finally, there are the axon terminals, which conduct electrical signals to the space between nerve cells (a nerve synapse) and send the signal to another cell&#039;s dendrites. You can also categorize neurons in another way, by dividing them into sensory neurons, motor neurons, and interneurons. Sensory neurons carry outside signals (outside your central nervous system) into your CNS (central nervous system), motor neurons carry CNS signals to the outside parts of your body, and interneurons connect both types. For a neuron to fire, they have to have an action potential. During an action potential, the neuron chooses whether or not to fire the signal, but there is no in-between because it either fires, or it doesn&#039;t. What else would you like to talk about?
