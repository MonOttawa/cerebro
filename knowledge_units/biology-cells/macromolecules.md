### Output
> Okay, let&#039;s talk about macromolecules! Despite how tiny cells seem, they are made of even smaller units called macromolecules. There are 4 main types of macromolecules - lipids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and proteins. [Here](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/high-school-biology/hs-biology-foundations/hs-biological-macromolecules/v/elements-and-atoms) is a link to a series of videos about these macromolecules. Watch the first couple of videos, and then tell me what you think!
