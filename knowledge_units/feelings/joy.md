### Output
> Joy is my favorite feeling, I love to feel happy! Did you know that feeling more joy promotes a healthier lifestyle, boosts immune system, fights stress and pain and supports longevity? Cool right? I found two interesting TED Talks about happiness, check them [here](https://www.ted.com/talks/robert_waldinger_what_makes_a_good_life_lessons_from_the_longest_study_on_happiness?utm_campaign=tedspread&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=tedcomshare) and [here](https://www.ted.com/talks/matthieu_ricard_the_habits_of_happiness?utm_campaign=tedspread&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=tedcomshare). Do you want to know more about emotions?
