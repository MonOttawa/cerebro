> Did you know that Antarctica is the coldest continent in the world? It&#039;s completely covered with ice, although part of it is melting due to climate change. There are no permanent inhabitants, except of scientists maintaining research stations in Antarctica as well as some penguins and other animals. Would you like to know more about continents?
