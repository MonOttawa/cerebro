> The Arctic Ocean is the smallest of the world&#039;s oceans. It covers an area of about 5,427,000 square miles (14,056,000 square kilometres). Did you know it is almost the size of Russia? It is surrounded by the land masses of Europe, North America, Greenland, and by several islands. It is partly covered by sea ice throughout the year, and almost completely in the winter months.
