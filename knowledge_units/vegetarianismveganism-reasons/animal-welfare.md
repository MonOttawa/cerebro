### Output
> Vegetarians are opposed to killing animals for food but consider it acceptable to consume animal by-products such as dairy and eggs, as long as the animals are kept in adequate conditions. Vegans are also opposed to the psychological and physical stress that animals may endure as a result of modern farming practice. This is why vegans also choose to avoid all animal by-products. Would you like to know more reasons why people chose a plant-based diet?
