### Output
> Vegetarians believe that the production of meat and animal products for mass consumption, especially through factory farming, is environmentally unsustainable. Livestock industry is one of the largest contributors to environmental degradation worldwide and modern practices of raising animals for food contribute to water and air pollution, climate change, land degradation, deforestation and loss of biodiversity. This habitat destruction is thought to contribute to the extinction of various animal species. By avoiding the consumption of any kind of meat, vegetarians make their contribution to protect the environment and the Earthâ€™s natural resources. Would you like to know more reasons why people chose a plant-based diet?
