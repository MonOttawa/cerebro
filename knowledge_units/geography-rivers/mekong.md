### Output
> The Mekong is the the 7th longest river in Asia and the 12th longest in the world. It runs about 2,703 miles (4,300 km) starting at the Tibetan Plateau to the Mekong Delta and into the South China Sea. The Mekong flows through 6 countries, including China, Burma, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia, making it an important route for transportation and trade despite its rapids and changing flow. Check it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mekong_river_basin.png). Would you like to know more about these rivers?
