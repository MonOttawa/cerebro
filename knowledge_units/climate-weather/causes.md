### Output
> Weather is driven by air pressure, temperature and moisture differences between one place and another. These differences can occur due to the sun&#039;s angle at any particular spot. Because the Earth&#039;s axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. This effect causes seasons. The common weather phenomena include wind, cloud, rain, snow, fog and dust storms. Less common events include natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes, typhoons and ice storms.
