### Output
> Weather has played a large and sometimes direct part in human history, causing smaller scale population movements but also intruding directly in historical events. Weather also affects the daily choices we make: the way we dress to stay warm or cool, enjoy outside activities or stay inside â€“ or evacuate to a safe place during extreme weather conditions. It can also have both immediate and delayed effects on health, food production and general well-being. Would you like to know more about weather?
