### Output
> Human activity such as agriculture and industry results in weather modification. The industrial emission of   sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere causes acid rain, pollutants caused bay agriculture and transport reduce air quality and visibility, and other human activities that emit greenhouse gases are fostering climate change. All of these weather modifications may pose serious threats to many aspects of civilization, including ecosystems, natural resources and food production, economic development, and human health.
