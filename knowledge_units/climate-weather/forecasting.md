### Output
> Have you ever looked up to the sky and wonder if it&#039;s going to rain? We all attempt to predict the weather sometimes. But it&#039;s harder than we think. Weather forecasting uses science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location. By collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere and using weather prediction models, meteorologists can project how the atmosphere will evolve. Would you like to know more about weather?
